## Reproducing the data analysis


DIA-NN and Dinosaur outputs are required to run the code. Please visit MASSIVE ____ and download the following:

1) "pD_HYE_MS1_Report.tsv" to run the code to generate figures for the translated vs not-translated quantitation.
2) "eJD1443_45_Report.tsv", "eJD1443.features.tsv", "eJD1444.features.tsv", and "eJD1445.features.tsv" to run the code to generate figures for the RT-deviations within and between runs.
